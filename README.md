# Triune-VR

Unity Version: 2021.3.1f1

Virtual Reality game demo for university purposes at CITM-UPC (Barcelona).

The game has been developed and tested in the Oculus Quest 2

The controls are the following:
- Grip button: grab objects (even from the distance) when the ray turns white.
- Trigger: used to shoot and reload. Also selects buttons and sliders in the menu.

The pistol starts in white meaning it has no bullets, when it has ammunition it is set with a color according to the essence loaded.
The reloading mechanic is done with the cannon on the left. To reload you have to grab it and aim to an essence present in the map represented with particles. To reload a bullet of that essence press the Trigger button mentioned before.

As there are 3 essences, enemies are killed with:
- Fire (Red) Enemy: killed with blue bullets. Immune against green and gets bigger with another red bullet.
- Water (Blue) Enemy: killed with green bullets. Immune against red and gets bigger with another blue bullet. 
- Nature (Green) Enemy: killed with red bullets. Immune against blue and gets bigger with another green bullet.
